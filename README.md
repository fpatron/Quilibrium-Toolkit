## Overview

* **Centralized Management:** manage multiple Quilibrium nodes from a single location, eliminating the need to interact with each node individually.
* **Simplified Actions:** perform common tasks like installation, backup, retrieval of information and rewards, starting/stopping/rebooting nodes with a single command.
* **Flexibility:** group your nodes for targeted management or manage them all at once.
* **Security:** leverage Ansible's robust features to manage passwords securely using Ansible Vault (explained in detail later).
* **Built with Ansible:** This toolkit utilizes the power of Ansible, a popular open-source automation tool, for efficient node management (https://github.com/ansible/ansible).

## Quick start

* Configure ```inventories/hosts.yml```
  - More details [here](docs/inventory.md)
* Configure ```inventories/group_vars/all.yml```
  - More details [here](docs/inventory.md)
* Launch the toolkit

## Getting Started
1. **Install Ansible**
```
apt install ansible
```
2. **Install Python 3**
```
apt install python3
```
3. **Clone this repository:** use git to clone this repository onto your local system.




## How to use it? <a id='ssHowToUseIt'></a>

The tools are provided as a script named ```qtools.sh```. To use it, follow this syntax:

```
./qtools.sh <command> <target>
```


* \<command\>: this defines the operation you want to perform on the target node(s).
* ```<target>```: this specifies the node(s) you want to target. It can be:
  * ```all```: Applies the action to all nodes defined in your ```inventory``` file.
  * A group name defined in your inventory (e.g., ```quilibrium```).
  * The hostname of a specific node (e.g., ```node01```).
